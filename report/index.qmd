**[Que Faire Ã  Paris ?](https://www.paris.fr/quefaire)** is a french website that list events happing in Paris. 

The event are archived at this [address](https://opendata.paris.fr/explore/dataset/que-faire-a-paris-/information/?disjunctive.tags&disjunctive.address_name&disjunctive.address_zipcode&disjunctive.address_city&disjunctive.pmr&disjunctive.blind&disjunctive.deaf&disjunctive.price_type&disjunctive.access_type&disjunctive.programs) in multiple formats including csv.

In this project we propose a normalized database to store the events based on the csv archive.

Course constraint :

> Code everything in psql. \
> Don't use pgsql functions to extract the data.
